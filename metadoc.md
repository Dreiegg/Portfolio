About Me - Coding Gallery

After studying art, I decided to try something new and give programming a try. What started as curiosity turned into a passion for the logical thinking and problem solving inherent in programming. This led me to study Multimedia Technology at FH Salzburg with a major in Game Development, which now allows me to focus even more on my technical skills. 

I've worked with languages like C#, Python and C++ and tools like Unity, Git and Docker. I've explored full-stack web development, but my projects have shown me that my skills and interests are better used in areas such as game design, technical art and graphics rendering. The selection of projects here represent key milestones in my journey and are usually the ones I've learned the most from.
