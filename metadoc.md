About Me

I'm an Interactive Media Artist based in Salzburg, Austria. That's my fancy way of saying that I love making games, and have developed a diverse set of skills across disciplines to make it happen.

My journey started with studying Fine Arts in Innsbruck, where I immersed myself in the world of visual creativity. Later, I took a sharp turn and dove into programming, discovering a passion for bringing interactive worlds to life. Now, as a game development student in Salzburg, I'm bringing these worlds together to create games that combine artistic expression with technical expertise.
